    "Data Analysis is a process of collecting, transforming, cleaning, and modeling data with the goal of discovering the required information. The results so obtained are communicated, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data visualization is at times used to portray the data for the ease of discovering the useful patterns in the data.\n",

    "To effectively carry out data analysis task, industry analyst often utilize tested and proven step-by-step process that helps them achieve the desired result (get meaningful insights). Data Analysis Process consists of the following phases that are iterative in nature: \n",

    "\n",
    "The most rewarding data analysis projects are those that are based on a question or an experiment. In the world of data analytics, defining or determining your objective is often referred to as defining the ‘problem statement’. In addition to defining a problem statement and finding a purpose, it is also necessary at this point to consider which metrics to track along the way. Also, be sure to identify sources of data when it’s time to collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement typically stems from a business problem or question. Therefore, before embarking on any analysis project, a data analyst must ask: 'what business problem am I trying to solve?' \n",
    "\n",
    "Some sample problem statements are:\n",
    "* How can we reduce production costs without sacrificing quality?\n",
    "* What are some ways to increase sales opportunities with our current resources?\n",
    "* Do customers see our brand positively?\n",
    "* Why are there long queues in the shop every friday?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase of the data analysis process, a data analyst’s main job is to understand the business and its goals in enough depth so as to be able to comprehend the root of an issue and frame the problem the right way."
